"""
The focus of the test is the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence.  The purpose of this test
is to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would
be expected for a truly random sequence.  The test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to Â½, that
is, the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence should be about the same.  All subsequent tests depend on
the passing of this test.

Note that if the P-value were small (< 0.01), then this would be caused by s or being large.
Large positive values of s are indicative of too many ones, and large negative values of s are indicative
of too many zeros.
