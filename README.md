This repository is associated to the paper "A crystallization robot for generating true random numbers based upon stochastic chemical processes . Lee, E., Gutierrez, J. M. P., Henson, A., Brechin, E. & Cronin, L. (2020). 

This is the software used for generation and validation of random numbers using images of crystallisations, as well as the determination of the Approximate Entropy (ApEn) associated with the generated numbers.
